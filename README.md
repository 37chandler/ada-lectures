# Applied Data Analytics Repository

Hello, and welcome to Applied Data Analytics, 
a core class in the University of Montana's Master of Science in Business Analytics. 
This repo holds code for the class. I'll push new commits about every week. Make sure 
to do a pull when you begin to watch the lectures and do the reading, probably on Friday
afternoons.
