# Applied Data Analytics Repository

Hello, and welcome to Applied Data Analytics, 
a core class in the University of Montana's Master of Science in Business Analytics. 
This repo holds code for the class. I'll push new commits about every week. Make sure 
to do a pull Monday night or Tuesday morning. I'll attempt to remember to send
a Slack message when I push.
